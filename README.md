Spotify Clone

Overview
This project is a responsive Spotify clone designed to mimic the core features of Spotify's interface. It includes a clean, user-friendly layout and features a playlist display with interactive elements. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.

Features
Responsive Design: The interface adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Interactive UI: Includes clickable elements such as playlists and buttons, with hover and active states for improved user interaction.
Playbar: A functional playbar with controls for previous, play/pause, and next, as well as a volume control slider.
Future Implementation
One key feature to be added is dynamic album content. This feature will allow users to click on an album to reveal new songs within it, which can then be played directly from the interface. This will enhance the interactive experience by providing a more dynamic and engaging way to explore music.
